## 📝 Assignment 2: Multiple Image Transformations  

### 🎯 Objectives  
- Understanding various **image transformation techniques**.  
- Implementing **resizing, rotation, and flipping** operations on images.  
- Visualizing multiple transformations in a **single figure**.  

### 🔧 Lab Tasks  

#### ✅ Task 1: Performing Multiple Transformations  
- Resize an image to **256×256 pixels**.  
- Rotate the image by **180 degrees clockwise**.  
- Apply a **vertical flip**.  
- Display all transformations in a **single subplot**.  

### 🛠️ Methodology  

#### 🚀 Tools and Libraries Used  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **OpenCV (cv2)**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib**  

#### 🔄 Implementation  
- **Image Loading:** The image is loaded from a URL using **OpenCV** and `urllib.request`.  
- **Resizing:** The image is resized to **256×256 pixels** using `cv2.resize()`.  
- **Rotation:** The image is rotated by **180 degrees** using `cv2.rotate()`.  
- **Flipping:** A **vertical flip** is applied using `cv2.flip()`.  
- **Visualization:** All transformations are displayed in a **single subplot** using Matplotlib.  

### 📊 Results  
The image transformations were successfully executed, demonstrating:  
✅ The effectiveness of **resizing** and maintaining aspect ratios.  
✅ The correct application of **rotation and flipping** techniques.  

## 🎯 Conclusion  
Both assignments successfully demonstrated **basic and intermediate image processing** techniques in Python. Region extraction, color space conversion, and transformation operations provided a **strong foundation** in digital image processing.  

## 🔮 Future Work  
- Extend the implementation to handle **real-time image inputs**.  
- Apply **edge detection and filtering** techniques.  
- Develop **interactive tools** for image manipulation.
